On load fires when sub-resources are loaded, but obviously doesn't include
upcoming AJAX and similar calls.
We don't measure sub-resources (though on-load is fired when sub-resources)

More extensive timing:
https://github.com/SOASTA/boomerang/blob/master/plugins/restiming.js
```
> window.performance.getEntries()
(6) [PerformanceNavigationTiming, PerformancePaintTiming, PerformancePaintTiming, PerformanceResourceTiming, PerformanceResourceTiming, PerformanceResourceTiming]

> performance.getEntriesByType("navigation");
var perf = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0]
perf.responseEnd - perf.connectStart
performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].responseEnd - performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].connectStart
```

For detailed inspection resource-by-resource, use

```
performance.getEntriesByType('resource')
```
